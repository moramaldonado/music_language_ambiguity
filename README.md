Pilot and results storage

- List the names of subjects in excel file with subject information possibly. 

- Results are stored in two different ways. 
1. A csv file (Results_Experiment2) stores the basic information for each subject. 
2. The folder subject_results contains a pickle file for each subject with all the information (pickle files can be opened in python)

- Before running each subject, check that the results are correctly stored! (and after) to avoid loosing data.

- Given that we will be running the pilot in two places at the same time, it would be ideal to store the results *in two different csv files* (just in case).  
BEFORE UPLOADING THE RESULTS IN GITHUB, PLEASE NAME THE FILE RESULTS_FABIAN/RESULTS_MORA
